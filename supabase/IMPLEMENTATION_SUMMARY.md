# CV Upload Storage Bucket Setup - Summary

## Problem Statement
Users encountered a "bucket not found" error when attempting to upload CVs through the Settings or Setup pages. The application code expected a Supabase storage bucket named `resumes` to exist, but there was no clear setup process or documentation for creating it.

## Solution Overview
This PR implements a comprehensive solution that includes:
1. Clear documentation for creating the storage bucket
2. SQL scripts for automated setup
3. Enhanced error handling with helpful messages
4. Complete test coverage for the upload functionality
5. Security considerations and best practices

## Changes Made

### ðŸ“„ New Documentation Files

#### 1. `supabase/STORAGE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
A comprehensive 200+ line guide that covers:
- **Three setup methods**: Dashboard UI, SQL Editor, and Supabase CLI
- **Step-by-step instructions** with exact bucket configuration values
- **Troubleshooting section** for common errors
- **Security considerations** for production deployments
- **File organization** and storage structure explanation

#### 2. `supabase/storage-setup.sql`
SQL script that creates:
- The `resumes` storage bucket with proper configuration
- Storage policies for user-specific access control
- MIME type restrictions and file size limits
- Comprehensive comments explaining each section

### ðŸ”§ Code Enhancements

#### 1. `src/lib/storage.ts` - Enhanced Error Handling
**Before:**
```typescript
if (uploadErr) throw uploadErr
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (uploadErr) {
    // Provide helpful error message if bucket doesn't exist
    if (uploadErr.message?.toLowerCase().includes('bucket') && 
        (uploadErr.message?.toLowerCase().includes('not found') || 
         uploadErr.message?.toLowerCase().includes('does not exist'))) {
        throw new Error(
            `Storage bucket '${RESUMES_BUCKET}' not found. ` +
            'Please create the bucket in Supabase Dashboard (Storage > Create bucket > Name: "resumes") ' +
            'or run the setup script in supabase/storage-setup.sql. ' +
            'See supabase/STORAGE_SETUP_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions.'
        )
    }
    throw uploadErr
}
```

**Impact:** Users now get actionable guidance instead of cryptic error messages.

#### 2. `src/pages/Settings.tsx` - Missing Import Fix
Added missing `FileText` icon import that was causing console warnings.

### ðŸ“š Documentation Updates

#### 1. `README.md`
- Added storage bucket setup as step 5 in Quick Start guide
- Provided quick reference to detailed setup guide

#### 2. `supabase/README.md`
- Expanded section 2.5 with comprehensive bucket creation options
- Added clear notes about bucket being required for CV upload
- Referenced detailed setup guide for troubleshooting

### ðŸ§ª Test Coverage

Created `src/lib/__tests__/storage.test.ts` with 5 comprehensive tests:

```
âœ“ should throw helpful error when bucket is not found
âœ“ should throw error when user is not authenticated
âœ“ should upload file successfully and return URL
âœ“ should handle upload error properly
âœ“ should sanitize file names properly
```

**Test Results:** 5/5 passing âœ…

## Bucket Configuration

### Required Settings
| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Name** | `resumes` | Hardcoded in application |
| **Public** | `true` | For MVP (can be private in production) |
| **File Size Limit** | 10 MB (10485760 bytes) | Prevents abuse |
| **Allowed MIME Types** | PDF, DOC, DOCX | Secure file type restrictions |

### Storage Policies
The setup creates four RLS policies:
1. **Upload Policy**: Users can only upload to their own folder (`{user_id}/`)
2. **Update Policy**: Users can only update their own files
3. **Delete Policy**: Users can only delete their own files
4. **Read Policy**: Public read access (MVP only)

### File Organization
Files are stored in a user-specific structure:
```
resumes/
  â”œâ”€â”€ {user_id_1}/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ {timestamp}-{sanitized_filename}.pdf
  â”œâ”€â”€ {user_id_2}/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ {timestamp}-{sanitized_filename}.pdf
  â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Setup Methods

### Method 1: Dashboard UI (Recommended for Beginners)
1. Navigate to Storage in Supabase Dashboard
2. Click "Create bucket"
3. Enter settings (name: `resumes`, public: ON, etc.)
4. Bucket is ready to use

**Time:** ~2 minutes

### Method 2: SQL Editor (Recommended for Developers)
1. Open SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard
2. Copy and paste `supabase/storage-setup.sql`
3. Run the script
4. Verify bucket creation in Storage section

**Time:** ~1 minute

### Method 3: Supabase CLI (For Local Development)
```bash
supabase start
supabase db execute -f supabase/storage-setup.sql
```

**Time:** ~30 seconds

## Security Considerations

### MVP (Current Setup)
- âœ… Public bucket for easy testing
- âœ… RLS policies prevent unauthorized access to user folders
- âœ… File size limits prevent abuse
- âœ… MIME type restrictions prevent malicious uploads

### Production Recommendations
1. **Private Bucket**: Set `public = false`
2. **Signed URLs**: Use `createSignedUrl()` with expiration
3. **File Scanning**: Implement malware scanning
4. **Rate Limiting**: Add upload rate limits
5. **Monitoring**: Track storage usage and unusual activity

These are documented in `STORAGE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` section "Security Considerations for Production".

## Error Handling

### Before
```
Error: Bucket "resumes" does not exist
```

### After
```
Error: Storage bucket 'resumes' not found. Please create the bucket in 
Supabase Dashboard (Storage > Create bucket > Name: "resumes") or run 
the setup script in supabase/storage-setup.sql. See 
supabase/STORAGE_SETUP_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions.
```

## Validation Results

| Check | Status | Details |
